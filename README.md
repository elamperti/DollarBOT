# DollarBot

This is a quick set of scripts to extract currency exchange values from publicly available data so it can be retrieved through Discord. It may be expanded to gather data from other sources and/or to be available on other platforms (Telegram, Slack). Requires Python3.

I will not actively maintain this project, but feel free to create pull requests or open issues with ideas or bugs.
